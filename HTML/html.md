### Important Notes
1. Head & body are children of HTML tag.
2. Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with some content. **eg:-** HTML elements = Start tag + Content + End tag
3. Some HTML tage have no content called *Empty Elements*. **Eg:** <   br  >

Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be passed. They can help in documents source code.
 
 <  !--           HTML Comments    -->

> **Note :-** HTML is case insensitive language, So you can use <    H1> or <    h1> tag both are same.
